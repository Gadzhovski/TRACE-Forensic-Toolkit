## Getting Started 🚀 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [⬆️](#toolkit-for-retrieval-and-analysis-of-cyber-evidence-trace)

### Prerequisites 🔧


#### For Windows:
*There's a compatibility issue with Python 3.12. Please install Python 3.11 from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/
<br>

If you don't already have Microsoft C++ Build Tools installed, you'll need to install them to compile required packages like libewf-python and pytsk3.

```bash
*If you encounter this error while installing dependencies:

"Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required"
It means your C++ Build Tools are missing or outdated, please follow the steps below to install the latest version of "C++ Build Tools".
```

Step 1: Download and Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
During the installation, make sure to select the following workloads:
  - Desktop development with C++
  - C++ build tools
  
Step 2: Install the Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```


#### For macOS - Apple Silicon:

Create a virtual environment with python 3.11

```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

```bash
chmod +x install_macos_silicon.sh
 ```

```bash
./install_macos_silicon.sh
 ```
**This script will:**
- Check if Homebrew is installed and offer to install it if it’s not.
- Install necessary system dependencies (ffmpeg and poppler) using Homebrew.
- Install all Python dependencies specified in requirements_macos_silicon.txt using pip.


#### For Ubuntu on WSL:
```bash
chmod +x WSL_Ubuntu_install.sh
```

```bash
./WSL_Ubuntu_install.sh
```

**This script will:**

- Update package lists and install necessary system packages including graphics libraries and sound management tools.
- Install necessary Python dependencies from requirements_macos_silicon.txt (same requirements for Ubuntu).


### Configuration ⚙️

**API Keys Configuration**:The tool integrates with VirusTotal and Veriphone APIs, and you will need to provide your own API keys to use these features. To update the API keys, go to the Options menu and select API Keys submenu.



### Running the Tool ▶️


```bash
python main.py
```
<br>

## Built With 🧱  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [⬆️](#toolkit-for-retrieval-and-analysis-of-cyber-evidence-trace)

- [pytsk3](https://pypi.org/project/pytsk3/) - Python bindings for the SleuthKit
- [libewf-python](https://github.com/libyal/libewf) - Library to access the Expert Witness Compression Format (EWF)
- [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/) - Used for the GUI components.
- [Arsenal Image Mounter](https://arsenalrecon.com/products/image-mounter/) - For mounting forensic disk images.


## Work in Progress 🧑‍🔧  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [⬆️](#toolkit-for-retrieval-and-analysis-of-cyber-evidence-trace)

- **Direct Video/Audio Playback**: Currently, the video and audio player saves files temporarily before playing them, which can cause delays. The goal is to enable direct playback for faster performance.
- **Integrated File Search and Viewer**: The file search functionality is not yet connected to the "Viewer Tab," which displays HEX, text, application-specific views, metadata, and other details. This integration needs to be implemented.
- **Cross-Platform Image Mounting**: Image mounting currently works only on Windows using the Arsenal Image Mounter executable. The aim is to make this feature work across all platforms without relying on external executables.
- **File Carving and Viewer Integration**: The file carving functionality is not yet connected to the "Viewer Tab," where users can view HEX, text, application-specific views, and metadata. Additionally, the current file carving process does not distinguish between deleted and non-deleted files; it will "carve" all files of the selected type from the disk image.
- **Color Issues in Dark Mode**: The software currently has some colour display issues on Linux and macOS systems when using dark mode. Certain UI elements may not be clearly visible or may appear incorrectly.

## Testing & Feedback 🧪  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [⬆️](#toolkit-for-retrieval-and-analysis-of-cyber-evidence-trace)

- **Tested Formats**: The tool has primarily been tested with `dd` and `E01` files. While these formats are well-supported, additional testing with other formats, such as `Ex01`, `Lx01`, `s01`, and others, is needed.
- **Tested File Systems**: Currently, the tool has only been tested on the NTFS file system. Testing on additional file systems like FAT32, exFAT, HFS+, APFS, EXT4, and others is needed to ensure broader compatibility.
- **Call for Samples**: If you have disk images in formats that are less tested (`Ex01`, `Lx01`, `s01`, etc.), your contributions would be greatly appreciated to help improve the tool's compatibility and robustness.
- **Feedback Welcome**: Please report any issues or unexpected behaviour to help improve the tool. Contributions and testing feedback are encouraged and welcomed.
